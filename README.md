# What is Empyrea?
Empyrea was an ambitious roguelike project that was started by David M. Haggard, and fully funded through Kickstarter. However, Mr. Haggard soon became busy with his life and had to abandon the project, releasing the full source code (in Python) as a meager consolidation prize. The full source code of Empyrea is https://bitbucket.org/dmhagar/empyrea-public/src/8296737b0dd2?at=master 

#Did You Know?
Empyrea was originally titled "Cult: Awakening of the Old Ones", however, Haggard himself disliked that name for religious reasons.
