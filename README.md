# Lament-of-Haggard
A history generator based on the "Empyrea" roguelike.

Due to the need to expand on the existing (and incomplete) history generator in Empyrea, I have to consult other games and programs for "inspiration". Those games/programs are listed in an "Additional Inspirations" section at the bottom of this Readme.

# What is Empyrea?
Empyrea was an ambitious roguelike project that was started by David M. Haggard, and fully funded through Kickstarter. However, Mr. Haggard soon became busy with his life and had to abandon the project, releasing the full source code (in Python) as a meager consolidation prize. The full source code of Empyrea is located at https://bitbucket.org/dmhagar/empyrea-public/src/8296737b0dd2?at=master 

#Did You Know?
Empyrea was originally titled "Cult: Awakening of the Old Ones", however, Haggard himself disliked that name for religious reasons.

#Additional Inspirations
--"History X" (http://orfinlir.de/3rdE/historyX.php), written in PHP, allows for a person to generate the history of a civilization based on a series of user-defined paramaters. The source code is available at http://orfinlir.de/3rdE/historyEngine.zip and the Dev Thread is at http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?74226-History-Generator .

What I Used: The possible events in "History X", as well as the mechanic of previous events affecting the odds of future events
